MONGO_URI='mongodb+srv://tarunsairayapureddi:OsZeLDveUccTAwG2@smart-agriculture.mopyk.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=smart-agriculture'
JWT_SECRET = 'tarun2002'
KEY_ID = 'rzp_test_e1X0p6CCPMH3MF'
KEY_SECRET = 'cJs2O3n1VRzj8M9TjX3yQmXF'
For the client, if required, create a .env file in the client directory:

env
Copy code
